Here are some awnsers to the questions that you asked me no need to awnser them again just read them and let me know if you have any questions.

1. Pine Strategy Structure: What specific fields does the Pine strategy contain that need to be converted? Could you provide an example of a Pine strategy and the expected JSON structure?

this is a simple Pine script that a user could input and sent to the backend
`
//@version=5
strategy("ATR Channel Breakout", overlay=true, pyramiding=10, initial_capital=100000, commission_type=strategy.commission.cash_per_order, commission_value=0.001, slippage=2)

// Inputs
smaLength = input.int(350, title="SMA Length")
atrLength = input.int(20, title="ATR Length")

ubOffset = input.float(7, title="Upperband Offset", step=0.50)
lbOffset = input.float(3, title="Lowerband Offset", step=0.50)

// Calculate indicators
smaValue = ta.sma(close, smaLength)
atrValue = ta.atr(atrLength)  // Corrected ATR calculation with single parameter

upperBand = smaValue + (ubOffset * atrValue)
lowerBand = smaValue - (lbOffset * atrValue)

// Plot indicators
plot(smaValue, title="SMA", color=color.orange)
plot(upperBand, title="Upper Band", color=color.green, linewidth=2)
plot(lowerBand, title="Lower Band", color=color.red, linewidth=2)

// Entry and exit conditions
longCondition = ta.crossover(close, upperBand)
shortCondition = ta.crossunder(close, lowerBand)

if (longCondition)
    strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long)

if (shortCondition)
    strategy.entry("Short", strategy.short)

exitCondition = ta.crossunder(close, smaValue)
if (exitCondition)
    strategy.close("Long")
    strategy.close("Short")

`

2. Settings Details: What kind of settings are typically included with the Pine strategy? Are these technical indicators, risk management settings, or something else?

The settings inlcude the following:
    - initialEquity (should be handled as float)
    - riskPerTrade (should be handled as float)
    - riskCapitalPerTrade (should be handled as float)
    - lookBack (should be handled as integer)
    - pair (should be handled as string)
    - interval (should be handled as string)
    - monteCarlo (should be handled as boolean)
    - commission (should be handled as float)
    - slippage (should be handled as float)
    - pyramiding (should be handled as integer)
    - apiKey (should be handled as string)
    - apiSecret (should be handled as string)

These settings takes priority over the default settings in the Pine script so int the settings say that the initialEquity is 100000 and the Pine script says that the initialEquity is 1000 then the initialEquity should be 100000. 

3. Backtest Logic:

    - How should the backtest function interpret the entry and exit conditions from the strategy? Are these simple conditions like price thresholds, or do they involve more complex logic?
    
    it's more complex the backtest should make an api request to the Binance exchange and get the historical data for the pair and interval that the user has specified in the settings. The backtest should then loop through the data and check if the conditions are met and then make a trade. The backtest should also keep track of the trades and calculate the performance metrics for each trade and the overall performance of the strategy. 


    - What kind of market data will be used for backtesting (e.g., historical price data)? How will this data be accessed within the backtest function?

    The data will be historical price data from the Binance exchange. The data will be accessed by making an api request to the Binance exchange and getting the historical data for the pair and interval that the user has specified in the settings.

4. Trade Result Details:

    - How are duration and maxDrawdown calculated for each trade?
    Are there any other metrics you want to track for each trade (e.g., entry/exit prices, timestamps)?

    The duration is calculated by taking the difference between the entry and exit timestamps. The maxDrawdown is calculated by taking the difference between the entry price and the lowest price during the trade. The other metrics that should be tracked for each trade are the entry and exit prices, the entry and exit timestamps, the trade type (long or short), the trade size, the trade result (profit or loss), the trade duration, and the maxDrawdown.

5. Performance Metrics:

    - Are there any additional performance metrics you need beyond what has been implemented?

    The additional performance metrics that should be implemented are:
    netProfit, grossProfit, grossLoss, maxRunUp, maxDrawdown, buyHoldReturn, sharpeRatio, sortinoRatio, profitFactor, maxContractsHeld, openPL, commissionPaid, totalClosedTrades, totalOpenTrades, numberWinningTrades, numberLosingTrades, percentProfitable, avgTrade, avgWinningTrade, avgLosingTrade, ratioAvgWinAvgLoss, largestWinningTrade, largestLosingTrade, avgBarsInTrades, avgBarsInWinningTrades, avgBarsInLosingTrades, (monteCarloDrawdown, monteCarloDrawdownPercent, monteCarloDrawdownDuration, monteCarloScore) lets ifnore the monteCarlo metrics for now.
    
    - Do you have specific formulas or methodologies for calculating any of these metrics?
    The metrics should be calculated as follows:
    netProfit = sum of all trade results
    grossProfit = sum of all profits
    grossLoss = sum of all losses
    maxRunUp = max of all runups
    maxDrawdown = max of all drawdowns
    buyHoldReturn = (last price - first price) / first price
    sharpeRatio = (average return - risk-free rate) / standard deviation of returns
    sortinoRatio = (average return - risk-free rate) / downside deviation of returns
    profitFactor = grossProfit / grossLoss
    maxContractsHeld = max number of contracts held at any time
    openPL = profit or loss of open trades
    commissionPaid = sum of all commissions paid
    totalClosedTrades = total number of closed trades
    totalOpenTrades = total number of open trades
    numberWinningTrades = total number of winning trades
    numberLosingTrades = total number of losing trades
    percentProfitable = (numberWinningTrades / totalClosedTrades) * 100
    avgTrade = netProfit / totalClosedTrades
    avgWinningTrade = grossProfit / numberWinningTrades
    avgLosingTrade = grossLoss / numberLosingTrades
    ratioAvgWinAvgLoss = avgWinningTrade / avgLosingTrade
    largestWinningTrade = max of all winning trades
    largestLosingTrade = max of all losing trades
    avgBarsInTrades = average number of bars in all trades
    avgBarsInWinningTrades = average number of bars in winning trades
    avgBarsInLosingTrades = average number of bars in losing trades
        

6. Error Handling:

    - What kind of error handling and logging do you need during the strategy conversion and backtest processes?

    The error handling should include checking for invalid strategies or settings, handling exceptions during the backtest process, and logging any errors or warnings that occur. The logging should provide detailed information about the errors, including the type of error, the context in which it occurred, and any relevant data or variables. The logging should be done in a structured format that can be easily parsed and analyzed later.
    
    - How should invalid strategies or settings be handled?
    By returning an error message to the user and providing details about the specific error that occurred.

7. Integration with Frontend:

    - Are there any specific formats or constraints for how the frontend sends strategy and settings data to the backend?
    
    This is how the fronetend send it's data to the backend so it looks like we have a object with the settings and the strategy is raw tesx:

    `
        Object { initialEquity: "1000", riskPerTrade: "1", riskCapitalPerTrade: "2", lookBack: "100", pair: "BTCUSDC", interval: "1", monteCarlo: false, commission: "0.001", slippage: "2", pyramiding: "", … }
        ​{
        Pyramiding: "3"
        ​
        apiKey: "pGiByzo9s21pycbqpErz5sFm5UlaqYHm8U80cj5X32cZNZck8vsTJFOdyjsvOeGi"
        ​
        apiSecret: "0Suu16JX7apOE372QYfLeliNpu6Ly5QMU9ThdXSDoGf0pwXIrpNft4eB08fnMvfJ"
        ​
        commission: "0.001"
        ​
        initialEquity: "1000"
        ​
        interval: "1"
        ​
        lookBack: "100"
        ​
        monteCarlo: false
        ​
        pair: "BTCUSDC"
        ​
        pyramiding: ""
        ​
        riskCapitalPerTrade: "2"
        ​
        riskPerTrade: "1"
        ​
        slippage: "2"
        ​}
       
        //@version=5
        strategy("ATR Channel Breakout", overlay=true, pyramiding=10, initial_capital=100000, commission_type=strategy.commission.cash_per_order, commission_value=0.001, slippage=2)

        // Inputs
        smaLength = input.int(350, title="SMA Length")
        atrLength = input.int(20, title="ATR Length")

        ubOffset = input.float(7, title="Upperband Offset", step=0.50)
        lbOffset = input.float(3, title="Lowerband Offset", step=0.50)

        // Calculate indicators
        smaValue = ta.sma(close, smaLength)
        atrValue = ta.atr(atrLength)  // Corrected ATR calculation with single parameter

        upperBand = smaValue + (ubOffset * atrValue)
        lowerBand = smaValue - (lbOffset * atrValue)

        // Plot indicators
        plot(smaValue, title="SMA", color=color.orange)
        plot(upperBand, title="Upper Band", color=color.green, linewidth=2)
        plot(lowerBand, title="Lower Band", color=color.red, linewidth=2)

        // Entry and exit conditions
        longCondition = ta.crossover(close, upperBand)
        shortCondition = ta.crossunder(close, lowerBand)

        if (longCondition)
            strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long)

        if (shortCondition)
            strategy.entry("Short", strategy.short)

        exitCondition = ta.crossunder(close, smaValue)
        if (exitCondition)
            strategy.close("Long")
            strategy.close("Short") Dashboard.tsx:48:15

    - What kind of feedback or responses should the backend provide to the frontend, especially in case of errors?

    The backend should provide detailed error messages that explain the issue and suggest possible solutions. The error messages should be structured and easy to understand, so the frontend can display them to the user in a user-friendly way. The backend should also provide feedback on the progress of the strategy conversion and backtest processes, so the frontend can inform the user about the status of their request. And of course the backend should provide the performance metrics to the frontend so the user can see how the strategy performed.

1. Historical Data Fetching: Do you have a specific method or library in mind for making API requests to Binance, or would you like a recommendation?
    We should use the Binance API to fetch the historical data. The Binance API provides a wide range of endpoints for fetching historical data, including candlestick data for different pairs and intervals. We can use the `axios` library in Node.js to make HTTP requests to the Binance API and fetch the historical data. where the api key and secret are stored in the settings object that the frontend sends to the backend.

2. API Rate Limits and Error Handling: How should the system handle API rate limits and potential errors when fetching historical data from Binance?
    The system should handle API rate limits by checking the response headers from the Binance API and respecting the rate limits specified by the headers. If the rate limit is exceeded, the system should wait for the specified time before making another request. The system should also handle potential errors by checking the response status code and handling different types of errors accordingly. For example, if the response status code is 429 (Too Many Requests), the system should wait and retry the request after the specified time.


3. Shaping Trade Logic: Do you have a preferred method or logic for interpreting the Pine script's entry and exit conditions in JavaScript/TypeScript?
    So here is where it gets intressting since we are reliant on openai api to convert the Pine script to a ts script we can't really know what the script will look like so we have to be able to handle all the different types of scripts that the openai api can return. Maybe we send the entire backtest script and prompt it to integrate the pine script into the backtest script. unless there is a better way to do this. do we need to send the pine script to the openai api or is there a library that we can use to convert the pine script to a ts script? 

    OR!!!
    We say fuck pine script and have the user write their strategy directly in ts??? 
    this would eleviate us from having to integrate openai and a bucng of headaces
    so then the question becomes how hard would that be? For the user to write for example RSI, MACD, ATR, Bolinger band etc for them self??
